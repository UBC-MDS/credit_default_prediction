## Summary

In this project, we built a classification model using Logistic
Regression to predict if credit account holders will make a default
payment next month. Default payment refers to a situation when a borrower is
unable to make timely payments, misses payments, or 
avoids or stops making payments on interest or principal owed. 
The model was trained on features that hold
information about the client’s last 6 months bill and payment history,
as well as several other characteristics such as: age, marital status,
education, and gender. We consider the positive class to be default
(client made a default payment). Overall, we are more interested in
minimizing Type I error (predicting no default payment, when in reality
the client made a default payment the following month), as opposed to
Type II error (predicting default payment, when in reality no default
payment was made by the client). However, given the fact that for
creditors it is at upmost importance to have as minimal error prompt
model as possible, we will use *f*1 as our primary scoring metric. *f*1
score is the harmonic mean of recall (shows how many among all positive
examples are correctly identified) and precision (shows how many among
the positive examples are actually positive) score providing a good idea
about both scores.

Our model’s test *f*1 score is 0.528 with recall and precision rate
being 0.587, 0.48 respectively. We also report average_precision_score
(AP) as it summarizes a precision-recall curve: the weighted mean of
precision achieved at each threshold, with the increase in recall from
the previous threshold used as the weight. This score tells us the
overall model performance on imbalance dataset. Overall, we conclude
that the model can correctly classify default payments roughly half of
the time.

The value of incorrectly identifying default or no default can cause a
lot of money and reputation to the company, we recommend continuing
study to improve this prediction model before it is put into production
in the credit companies. Some of the improvement research topics can be
feature engineering, bigger dataset collected from other countries
(China, Canada, Japan).

## Introduction

Default payment refers to a situation when a borrower is unable to make
timely payments, misses payments, avoids/stops making payments on
interest or principal owed. An account is considered a default when the
minimum payment is not made for a consecutive 6 months period.
Predicting potential credit default accounts is challenging but at the
same time crucial for credit card companies. The default can happen for
various reasons: the loss of a job, change in the financial market,
personal difficulties, inability to work, health issues, need to use the
extra cash for other bills, etc. All of the examples described can be
considered as “out-of-control” from the customers’ side. However, the
default can also be intentional. An example of intentional default is
when the client knows that they are no longer financially stable enough
for credit, but continues to use credit until the bank intervenes
(Islam, Eberle, and Ghafoor 2018). The existence of such loopholes makes
it essential for creditors to detect default accounts as soon as
possible. In general for creditors, the earlier they detect the
potential default accounts, the lower their losses will be (Nor, Ismail,
and Yap 2019).

Here we ask if we can use machine-learning algorithms to predict whether
a customer will do a default payment next month or not. The detection of
default depends on extensive data profiling of customer’s finance, along
with other information such as their age, payment history, marriage
status, gender, education. For the creditors, it is most important to
have the model that predicts the account’s next month’s status,
especially if the client is going to make a default payment. The correct
prediction will help creditors to plan their risk management and take
steps before the situation gets out of control.

## Methods

### Data

The data set used in the project is created by Yeh, I. C., and Lien, C.
H (Yeh and Lien 2009), and made publicly available for download in UCI
Machine Learning Repository (“<span class="nocase">default of credit
card clients</span>” 2016). The data can be found
[here](https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients),
specifically [this
file](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00350/default%20of%20credit%20card%20clients.xls).
The dataset is based on Taiwan’s credit card client default cases from
April to September. It has 30000 examples, and each example represents
particular client’s information. The dataset has 24 observations with
respective values such as gender, age, marital status, last 6 months
bills, last 6 months payments, etc, including the final default payment
of next month column: labeled 1 (client will make a default) and 0
(client will not make a default).

### Analysis

As mentioned previously, our data set consists of 30000 observations,
which we consider as the large enough sample for using Logistic
Regression as the primary method. In addition, the features, that are
being used to train the model on, are relevant to the target class, thus
Logistic Regression will give us the results that are reliable, and easy
to interpret to stakeholders. Moreover, Logistic Regression algorithm is
one of the most popular ways to fit models for categorical data,
especially for binary response data in data modeling.

Therefore, we choose to conduct analysis and build a classification
model for the default credit card dataset using Logistic Regression. The
question in hand is to predict whether the client will make a default
payment in the next month (can be found in the “default payment next
month” column with binary label).

Before starting the tuning, we splited our data set into train and test
sets. 20% of the observations will be included in the test data and 80%
in the train data set. The split will ensure the needed balance for
having enough data for the fitting and cross validation set, as well as
large enough test data for the final affirmation of the model: more
precisely, the train set will have 24000 observations, and test set
6000. To have generalizable results, cross validation was carried out on
the train set with 10 folds. The best hyperparameters (C and
class_weight) were chosen by randomized search.

All the features included in the original dataset were used for tuning
and fitting the model. The hyperparameter *C*,
*c**l**a**s**s*\_*w**e**i**g**h**t* were chosen using 10
cross-validations with *f*1 score as primary scoring metric (recall and
average precision also considered). The Python programming language (Van
Rossum and Drake 2009) and the following Python packages were used for
the model analysis: docopt (Keleshev 2014), sklearn (Buitinck et al.
2013), altair (VanderPlas et al. 2018), pandas (McKinney et al. 2010),
numpy (Harris et al. 2020), os (Van Rossum and Drake 2009), requests
(Chandra and Varanasi 2015), pickle (Van Rossum 2020), matplot (Hunter
2007), seaborn (Waskom et al. 2017); as well as R programming language
(R Core Team 2021) for generating this report and the following
packages: knitr (Xie 2014), tidyverse (Wickham 2017). The code used to
perform the analysis and create the report can be found
[here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/credit_default_prediction).

## Results & Discussion

### Understanding the relationship between features and target class

In order to understand which features play an important role in the
decision making and prediction within the model, we will be analyzing
the correlations between features and also how they correlate to the
target class. So that we can get the most accurate correlations, we are
looking at the transformed data and eliminating any sort of initial
biases in the data. Note that correlation numbers range anywhere between
-1 to 1, here we will be calculation correlation numbers between either
two feature or a feature and a target class. Negative numbers indicate a
negative correlation, which means that if we are looking the correlation
number between two features, it could be that if one feature value
increases the other feature value decreases (and vice versa), -1 is
highest possible negative correlation. Similarly positive numbers
indicate a positive correlation, which means that if we are looking the
correlation number between two features, it could be that if one feature
increases the other feature also increases (and vice versa), +1 is the
highest possible positive correlation. Lastly, zero represent no
correlation between the two variables. It is important to note that we
don’t exactly know which direction the correlation is pointing, however
in our case we are more concerned with seeing which features would play
a higher role in the decision making of the model.

Figure 1 plots the correlation heat map, here there are two major
observations:

1.  We see high positive correlations among the `BILL_AMT` features,
    those features represent the bill amount for each month for 6 months
    going from April to September, 2005 (where `BILL_AMT1` represents
    bill amount for April). This positive correlation can indicate to
    two things: higher bill amounts in a month would most likely lead to
    higher amounts in the next month, and secondly those higher amounts
    in the next month can be associated with client’s bill amounts
    accumulating because they haven’t made their payments on time.

2.  We see that most of the feature firstly have low correlation in
    general with the target feature. Additionally, most of them show a
    negative correlation with the target feature.

### The evaluation of the method

With the accuracy as the scoring metric, the Logistic regression
prediction model produced good results, with the test accuracy of
**0.819**. However, as our project focuses on predicting the clients
with credit defaults, it’s crucial for our model to predict Defaulter
class correctly and minimize the misclassification error. To identify
the actual errors made by the model, we checked the values of metrics
**recall, precision and f1 score** for **Defaulter class**: **recall =
0.362, precision = 0.651, f1_score = 0.465**. It can be observed that
the recall for Defaulter class is significantly less than the precision.
The detailed classification of classes in terms of numbers can be seen
below. The **AP score** is **0.374** which is every low for this case
due to large number of misclassifications for Defaulter class
(i.e. higher FN’s). The detailed classification of classes in terms of
numbers can be seen below.

parameters

The reason for such large number of Type II errors (False negatives)
could be due to class imbalance in data set. So, to identify and
minimize the effect of imbalance, we choose to change the training
procedure by taking advantage of sklearn parameter called class_weight.
class_weight = ‘balanced’ gives higher weight to minority class (1) and
lower weight to majority class (0) to balance out their representation
in the dataset.

Hyperparameter tuning was performed on the Logistic regression model for
C and class_weight hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV. C
hyperparameter defines the complexity of the model: higher value of C
means a more complex model. Since C value determines the log loss on the
dataset, we have will be testing out values \[0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10,
100, 1000\] for C, and for class_weight hyperparamter we will be testing
out values \[‘None’, ‘balanced’\]. It is important to note that there
are some limitations to using RandomizedSearchCV as opposed to other
methods to find the best hyperparamters, one such limitation is that it
may not necessarily find the best hyperparamters, it is not exhaustive
and will only look at a few different combinations. However,
RandomizedSearchCV is much more faster and flexible with large datasets
like ours.

After carrying out Random Search cross validation with 10 folds, Figure
3 shows the different combination of the two hyperparamters along with
the scores of those models. We see that the model provides the best
score with class weights equal to “balanced” and C equal to 0.1. These
returned best parameters were used to evaluate the model on the test
data.

Figure 3. Comparison of scores while tuning hyperparamters for the
Logistic Regression model

</center>

The model from random search gives **test accuracy score** of **0.772**
and metrics **recall, precision and f1-score** for **Defaulter class**
are **0.587, 0.48, 0.528** respectively. Thus, through hyperparameter
tuning, we were able to achieve higher recall and f1-score. However,
there is always trade-off between recall and precision, as evidenced
with the lower precision score for the tuned model. The **AP score** is
**0.372** which is even lower than we received earlier but since we want
to minimize the misclassifications on Defaulter class (FN), the False
positives would increase and hence average precision would decrease.
There is always a tradeoff between recall and precision and the correct
amount of trade-off or accepted recall and precision score is somewhat
business dependent as these scores highly impact the business costs and
strategies. The detailed classification of target can be seen below:

### Conclusion

To conclude, even though the scores are not very high, we believe our
model is generalizable for the unseen data. However, given the
importance for the companies to have high rates for predicting the
Default class, we acknowledge that our model may not be the best suit
for the most companies.In future, as we grow our knowledge on new
techniques of handling such datasets, we will keep contributing to this
project for improvement.

### Discussion

To further improve this model in future with hopes that it will be used
for credit companies, there are several things we can suggest. Firstly,
feature engineering can help us boost our *f*1 score. We believe that
the expert knowledge will help to dive deeper into the problem and add
features such as the combination ratio of payment and bill, to help our
model to rank the features more accurately. Secondly, we will try other
classification algorithms such as Random Forest, with the hopes of
getting better score and less error pron model. Finally, we will collect
more data from other countries such as China, Canada, Japan to have
bigger understanding of the trends in default credit payment and train
our model with larger data set.
